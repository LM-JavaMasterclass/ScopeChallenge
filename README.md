          Challenge: Scope
          
          Open code with preferred Java IDE and run. Simple code to understand scope 
          by using same name in all variables used.

         Write a small program to read an integer from the keyboard
         (using Scanner) and print out the times table for that number.
         The table should run from 1 to 12.

         You are allowed to use one variable called scanner for your
         Scanner instance. You can use as many other variables as you
         need, but they must must all be called x. That includes any
         class instances and loop control variables that you may decide
         to use.

         If you use a class, the class can be called X (capital), but
         any instances of it must be called x (lower case).

         Any methods you create must also be called x.

         Optional Extra:
         Change your program so that ALL variables (including the scanner
         instance) are called x.
